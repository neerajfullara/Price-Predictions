# Price-Predictions
In this project, I created a machine-learning model with linear regression on Boston housing dataset. This model will aid us in making better real estate decisions by making house price predictions in that area. For this, we will carry out data exploration for a better understanding of the data and will require preprocessing to improve the model accuracy.
In this project, we need some Libraries.
