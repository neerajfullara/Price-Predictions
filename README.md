# Price-Predictions

Data Exploration: Conducted thorough exploration of the Boston housing dataset using Python, NumPy, and Pandas libraries, analyzing key features such as crime rate, property tax, and room count to gain insights into the factors influencing house prices.
Preprocessing: Implemented preprocessing techniques utilizing libraries like NumPy and Pandas to handle missing values, normalize features, and address any outliers, ensuring the data is clean and suitable for training the linear regression model.
Model Development: Utilized Scikit-learn library for implementing linear regression model on the preprocessed dataset, leveraging its robust functionality for training and evaluating the model's performance in predicting house prices accurately.
Visualization and Analysis: Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization, generating informative plots such as scatter plots and histograms to visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable, facilitating better understanding and interpretation of the model's predictions.
